# DYNAMIC-OBSTACLE-AVOIDANCE-IN-A-MULTI-ROBOT-SYSTEM-IoT
Dynamic obstacle avoidance in a multi-robot system is a system consisting of two robots in a grid like structure. These robots are completely autonomous and alter their paths solely based on interactive communication through a wireless protocol. The three main aspects that form the backbone of this system are: the pose of the robots, the direction of movement of the robot and the operating velocity of the robots. Differential Drive robots will be used to traverse in a straight-line path. The communication aspect of the system is through a wireless protocol called MQTT [Message Queuing Telemetry Transport] which works on a Publish-Subscribe mechanism, making it flexible for multi-robot communication. The robots are programmed to avoid the static obstacles along with the dynamic obstacles present on the gird.
